# ⚠️ DEPRECATED - File Moved

This file has been moved to the proper documentation location.

**New Location:**
```
Docs/AscentTraining_Docs/architecture/agents/usage-guide.md
```

**Why?**
The `.claude/agents/` directory should only contain agent definition files (*.md for sub-agents), not documentation. All user-facing guides and documentation belong in `Docs/AscentTraining_Docs/`.

**What to do:**
- Use the file at the new location above
- This file can be safely ignored or deleted
